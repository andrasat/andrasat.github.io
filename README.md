I'm a Biology Major Graduate, right now I have around 5+ yoe developing web apps, mainly using JS/TS with libs/frameworks like React, NodeJS, GraphQL, ExpressJS, NestJS, NextJS, working with databases like PostgresQL, MongoDB, MySQL. Currently I'm refactoring TS microservices into Golang while optimizing logics, in my current main job.

- etc

### CSS
